# Learning Deep-Leanrning with code-basics

I learned deep-learning and Mechine-learning with youtuber code-basics <br/>
He has a Tutorial courses about 49 videos and he explains the fundamental concepts about deep-learning and further applications.


Basically, in order to educate model to do something, it uses Neural-Network(NN).


Through this courses, I learned 3 important types of Neural-Network(NN), <br/>
which is Analog-Neural-Network(ANN), Convolutional-Neural-Network(CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network(RNN).

In using these 3 NN, I can analyze and make a prediction model of various kind of aspects.

Here is the main similarities and differiencies of these 3 NN.

Now I am going to explain what I learned these 3 NN.

## 1. Analog-Neural-Network(ANN)

## 2. Convolutional-Neural-Network(CNN

## 3. Recurrent Neural Network(RNN)
